OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a link-state routing protocol used in IP networks to determine the best path for data packets. It operates within a single autonomous system (AS) and uses the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm, based on Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, to compute the most efficient routes.
