Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol developed by Cisco. It improves upon traditional protocols like RIP by offering faster convergence and better scalability

Key Features of EIGRP:
- Hybrid Protocol: Combines features of both distance-vector and link-state protocols.
- DUAL Algorithm: Uses the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to ensure loop-free routing.
- Metric Calculation: Uses a composite metric based on bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load.
- Neighbor Discovery: Establishes neighbor relationships using Hello packets.
- Supports VLSM & CIDR: Allows for efficient IP address allocation
